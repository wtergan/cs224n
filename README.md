### Overview
Code solutions for each assignment in Stanford's cs224n course.
While each assignment composed of a written portion as well, I placed heavy emphasis on solving the coding portion.
Will attempt to complete the written portion of the assignments when time allows so.
All code is heavily commented and explained in detail.
